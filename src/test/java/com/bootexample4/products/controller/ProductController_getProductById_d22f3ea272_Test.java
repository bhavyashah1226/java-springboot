================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Exception Handling
Issue: The method getProductById does not handle exceptions that may occur when interacting with the productRepository, such as database connection issues, which could result in stack traces being exposed to the client, leading to information leakage.
Solution: Implement proper exception handling with try-catch blocks to catch potential exceptions and return a user-friendly error message without revealing internal details.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: The id parameter received by the getProductById method does not go through any validation to check for malicious input, which may lead to security issues like injection attacks.
Solution: Validate the id parameter before using it to query the database to ensure that it meets the expected format and range, and sanitize the input if necessary.

Vulnerability: Path Traversal
Issue: If the id is used to reference file paths or other resources, not properly checking the id can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities, where an attacker could access unauthorized files.
Solution: Ensure proper sanitization of the id to prevent path manipulation and access control checks to restrict access to unauthorized files or directories.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The method allows direct access to product objects by their id without any authorization checks, which could allow an attacker to access or modify data they should not have access to.
Solution: Implement access control measures to verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access or modify the resource before processing the request.

Vulnerability: Missing Security Headers
Issue: The response does not explicitly include security-related HTTP headers that can help mitigate certain types of attacks such as clickjacking.
Solution: Include security headers such as X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and Content-Security-Policy in the HTTP response to enhance security.

Vulnerability: Dependency Vulnerabilities
Issue: The code mentions imports from external libraries but does not address the potential for using outdated versions with known vulnerabilities.
Solution: Regularly update all dependencies to their latest versions and use a dependency-check tool to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of a product by valid ID

Details:  
  TestName: getProductByIdWithValidId
  Description: This test will verify that the method successfully retrieves a product when a valid ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and save a Product with a known ID. Mock the `findById` method of the `ProductRepository` to return this Product when the same ID is provided.
  Act: Call `getProductById` with the valid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is a `ResponseEntity` with the `OK` status and that the body contains the expected `Product`.
Validation: 
  Ensure that the product returned has the same ID that was searched for, validating that the `findById` method functions correctly. It's significant as it confirms product retrieval by ID is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Product not found for an invalid ID

Details:  
  TestName: getProductByIdWithInvalidId
  Description: This test will verify that the method returns the appropriate response when an ID that does not correspond to any product is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `findById` method of the `ProductRepository` to return an empty `Optional` when an invalid ID is provided.
  Act: Call `getProductById` with the invalid ID.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is a `ResponseEntity` with a `NotFound` status.
Validation: 
  Check that a `NotFound` response is returned for an invalid ID, which implies that the error handling is working correctly, maintaining the integrity of the application by not returning any product when the ID does not exist.

Scenario 3: Valid ID with repository throwing an exception

Details:  
  TestName: getProductByIdWhenRepositoryThrowsException
  Description: This test will verify that the method behaves correctly when the underlying `ProductRepository` throws an exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `findById` method of the `ProductRepository` to throw a runtime exception when a particular ID is provided.
  Act: Attempt to invoke `getProductById` with the ID that causes the exception.
  Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  Confirm that the method surfaces the exception thrown by the repository, which is important to understand when the retrieval functionality is not working due to underlying data access layers.

Scenario 4: Retrieval by ID when ID is null

Details:  
  TestName: getProductByIdWithNullId
  Description: This test checks how the method handles a `null` ID input, assuming the method signature allows nullable input.
Execution:
  Arrange: (Non-required, as input is null).
  Act: Call `getProductById` with a `null` ID.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is a `ResponseEntity` with a `BadRequest` or other suitable error status.
Validation: 
  Validate that the application gracefully handles null inputs by returning an error response. This test ensures robust input validation and prevents the method from proceeding with a null value, potentially causing null pointer exceptions.

// Alternatively, if the model should be widely accessible, correcting the class visibility
// to public is required.
