@When("the client sends a DELETE request to {string}")
public void the_client_sends_a_delete_request_to(String string) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    Long id = getProductIDfromAPI(string);
    deleteProductResponse = productController.deleteProduct(id);
    responseStatusCode = deleteProductResponse.getStatusCode();
}
"Scenario 1: Product with given ID exists and successfully deleted

Details:
  TestName: productExistsAndDeletedSuccessfully
  Description: This test aims to verify that the product with a given ID could be found and successfully deleted from the repository. This scenario assumes a product with the provided ID already exists in the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Product Repository's "findById" method to return an Optional of a Product object when a specific ID is passed.
  Act: Make a DELETE request by invoking the "deleteProduct" method on the controller with that ID.
  Assert: It should return a ResponseEntity with HTTP status OK (200).

Validation:
  The destructor verifies that the returned ResponseEntity's HTTP status is 200 OK. If the product deletion is successful, this would confirm that the method works correctly when a product exists in the repository. Then it's also essential to verify that the repository's delete method was called to ensure the execution of the deletion statement.

Scenario 2: No product with the given ID exists

Details:
  TestName: productDoesNotExists
  Description: This test aims to verify that attempting to delete a product that doesn't exist in the repository leads to an adequate response. It assumes no product with the provided ID exists in the repository.

Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the Product Repository's "findById" method to return an Optional.empty() when a specific ID is passed.
  Act: Make a DELETE request by invoking the "deleteProduct" method on the controller with that ID.
  Assert: It should return a ResponseEntity with an HTTP status of NOT_FOUND (404).

Validation:
  If no product can be found for the provided ID, the method correctly returns a ResponseEntity with HTTP status 404 NOT_FOUND. This confirms that the method has an adequate handling mechanism for non-existent products. The delete method of the repository should not be called in this scenario, which again can be verified.

Scenario 3: Null ID passed to the DELETE

Details:
  TestName: nullIdPassedToDelete
  Description: This test checks that appropriate action is taken when null is used as the ID in the DELETE call.

Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed as null will be passed as an argument to the method.
  Act: Make a DELETE request by invoking the "deleteProduct" method on the controller with null.
  Assert: An exception should be thrown.

Validation:
  The method should handle a null ID appropriately and so it should throw an exception. The significance is to validate that the method can handle null inputs and result in an exception appropriately. A null argument suggests an error either in the client or in earlier server-side processing.
