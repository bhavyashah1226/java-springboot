================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The use of GET request methods with query strings can potentially expose sensitive information in logs, caches, and browser history.
Solution: Avoid using sensitive information in the GET request. If necessary, use POST method instead.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Error Message Information Leak
Issue: The provided code does not handle exceptions, which might cause the exposure of sensitive system-level details in error messages.
Solution: Implement a global exception handling mechanism to catch any unhandled exceptions. Ensure that error messages displayed to the user do not reveal any sensitive system information.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: If the API is not properly protected, it might be vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker could trick a victim into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens and check for the token in each state-changing request. Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: Unvalidated input for the 'id' parameter could lead to directory traversal attacks or lead to unintended access to files and directories.
Solution: Validate and sanitize the 'id' parameter to ensure it does not contain relative path sequences.

Scenario 1: Test to delete existing product

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct method can successfully delete a product that exists in the product repository. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock product with a specific ID and add it to the mock product repository. 
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the ID of the mock product.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the product repository no longer contains the deleted product.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method can successfully remove a product from the repository. This test is significant in that it ensures the application can delete products correctly when given a valid ID.

Scenario 2: Test to delete non-existing product

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check how the deleteProduct method handles a request to delete a product that does not exist in the product repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that the mock product repository does not contain a product with the target ID.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with an ID that does not correspond to any product in the repository.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns a ResponseEntity with a NOT_FOUND status.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method correctly handles attempts to delete non-existing products. This test is important for ensuring the robustness of the application's error handling.

Scenario 3: Test to delete product with null ID

Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is designed to check how the deleteProduct method handles a request to delete a product with a null ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement is required for this test.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null ID.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method throws an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method can correctly handle null IDs. This test is important for ensuring the application is robust against null pointer exceptions.
