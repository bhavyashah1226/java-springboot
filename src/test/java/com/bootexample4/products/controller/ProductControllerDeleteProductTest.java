"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the deletion of a product given a valid product id.
Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithValidId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the deleteProduct method when provided with a valid product id. The target scenario is when a product id that exists in the product repository is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return a valid Product when findById is called with a specific id.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned ResponseEntity has an HTTP status of OK (200).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the product is successfully deleted from the repository when a valid id is provided. The expected result is a response entity with a status of OK, indicating successful deletion. This test is significant in ensuring the delete functionality works as expected.
Scenario 2: Test to verify the behavior of the deleteProduct method when provided with an invalid product id.
Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithInvalidId
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the deleteProduct method when provided with an invalid product id. The target scenario is when a product id that does not exist in the product repository is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a specific id.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id that does not exist in the repository.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned ResponseEntity has an HTTP status of NOT FOUND (404).
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method handles non-existent product ids correctly by returning a response entity with a status of NOT FOUND. This test is significant in ensuring the method can gracefully handle errors and provide appropriate responses.
Scenario 3: Test to ensure the deleteProduct method calls the repository's delete method for valid product ids.
Details:
  TestName: testDeleteProductRepositoryInteraction
  Description: This test is meant to check that the deleteProduct method interacts correctly with the product repository. The target scenario is when a valid product id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the productRepository and a Product. Set the repository to return the mocked Product when findById is called with a specific id.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the mocked product.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the delete method on the productRepository was called with the correct product.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the deleteProduct method interacts correctly with the product repository by calling its delete method with the correct product. This test is significant in ensuring the method correctly interacts with the repository.
