Scenario 1: Deleting a Product Successfully
  Details:
    TestName: deleteProductSuccessfully
    Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct method successfully removes an existing product from the productRepository.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An existing product in the productRepository with a known id.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the known product id.
    Assert: Ensure the ResponseEntity returned has the status "Ok" and the repository no longer contains the deleted product.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the product is successfully removed from the repository and the correct status is returned. This test is significant in observing the correct behavior when a product is meant to be deleted from the system.

Scenario 2: Trying to Delete a non-existing Product
  Details:
    TestName: deleteProductNotFound
    Description: This test is used to check if the deleteProduct method handles a situation where the product to delete doesn't exist.

    Arrange: No arrange required as no product exists in the productRepository.
    Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a product id that doesn't exist.
    Assert: Ensure the ResponseEntity returned has the status "NotFound".
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method returns an appropriate NotFound status when attempting to delete a product that doesn't exist. It is important to ensure the system behaves accurately when dealing with non-existent data.

Scenario 3: DeleteProduct Called With a null id
  Details:
    TestName: deleteProductNullId
    Description: This test is meant to check the handling of the deleteProduct method when called with a null id.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange required.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct method with a null id.
    Assert: A NullPointerException or an adequate custom exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method behaves adequately when provided with invalid input (null). This test helps ensure that the system is robust and handles error scenarios correctly.

Scenario 4: DeleteProduct With Invalid id
  Details:
    TestName: deleteProductWithInvalidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct handles the scenario when an invalid id (not corresponding to any product) is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A list of products in the productRepository, however none with the id that's going to be used.
    Act: Invoke deleteProduct method providing the invalid id.
    Assert: Check the ResponseEntity returned has the status "NotFound".
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that nothing is deleted and an appropriate status is returned. This test helps to ensure that the deletion method does not impact other records when provided with an invalid id.
