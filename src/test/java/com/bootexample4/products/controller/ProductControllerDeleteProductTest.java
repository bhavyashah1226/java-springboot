================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The deleteProduct method uses a GET request to delete data, which can expose sensitive information in server logs, browser history, and browser cache. This can lead to unauthorized data exposure or manipulation.
Solution: Use a POST or DELETE request instead of a GET request to delete data. This aligns with the principles of RESTful API design and also provides better security.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The deleteProduct method does not validate if the user is authorized to delete the product. An unauthorized user may exploit this to delete data.
Solution: Implement proper session management. Always validate the user's session and their authorization to perform actions such as deleting data.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The deleteProduct method does not sanitize or validate the input, which can lead to SQL injection attacks if the input is used in SQL queries.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user input. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to delete existing product

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct method can successfully delete a product that exists in the product repository. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a valid product when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with the id of the existing product.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned ResponseEntity's status is OK (200).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the product was successfully deleted from the repository. The expected result is a ResponseEntity with a status of OK. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 2: Test to delete non-existing product

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteNonExistingProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct method can handle the scenario when a non-existing product id is provided for deletion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a non-existing product id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned ResponseEntity's status is NOT_FOUND (404).
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case when a non-existing product id is provided. The expected result is a ResponseEntity with a status of NOT_FOUND. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the deleteProduct method.

Scenario 3: Test to delete product with null id

Details:  
  TestName: testDeleteProductWithNullId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the deleteProduct method can handle the scenario when a null id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to mock the ProductRepository as the method will throw an exception before it's used.
  Act: Invoke the deleteProduct method with a null id.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an IllegalArgumentException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly throws an exception when a null id is provided. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the deleteProduct method when provided with invalid input.
