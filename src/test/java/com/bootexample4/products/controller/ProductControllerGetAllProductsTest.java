================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If the 'findAll' method is used in a GET request, it could lead to potential information exposure.
Solution: It's recommended to use POST requests for sensitive information retrieval or limit the amount of data returned by the 'findAll' method.

Vulnerability: CWE-943: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: If object references are directly exposed to users, they can manipulate them to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Always validate user input and use access controls to ensure they can only access authorized data.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Without CSRF protections, attackers can trick victims into performing actions without their consent.
Solution: Implement CSRF tokens in your application, which Spring Security can help you with.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the 'ProductRepository' uses raw SQL queries, it might be susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM libraries to mitigate this risk.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the retrieval of all products

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAllProducts
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of fetching all products from the database. The target scenario is when there are multiple products in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a list of products when findAll() is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual results against the expected list of products.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns a list of all products in the database. The expected result is based on the mocked response from the ProductRepository. This test is significant in ensuring that the application correctly fetches all products.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the behavior when there are no products

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAllProductsWhenNoProducts
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of fetching all products when the database is empty. The target scenario is when there are no products in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty list when findAll() is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned list is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method returns an empty list when there are no products in the database. This test is significant in ensuring that the application correctly handles the scenario when there are no products.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the behavior when the database operation fails

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAllProductsWhenDatabaseOperationFails
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of fetching all products when the database operation fails. The target scenario is when there's a failure in the database operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to throw a RuntimeException when findAll() is called.
  Act: Invoke the getAllProducts() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that a RuntimeException is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method throws a RuntimeException when the database operation fails. This test is significant in ensuring that the application correctly handles the scenario when there's a failure in the database operation.
