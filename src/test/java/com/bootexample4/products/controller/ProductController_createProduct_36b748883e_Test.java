Test Scenario 1: Valid Product
Given a valid Product object, when the `createProduct` method is called, then the product should be persisted in the product repository, and the same product should be returned.

Test Scenario 2: Null Product
Given a null Product object, when the `createProduct` method is called, then an exception should be thrown, indicating that the product cannot be null.

Test Scenario 3: Product with existing ID
Given a Product object with an ID that already exists in the product repository, when the `createProduct` method is called, then an exception should be thrown, indicating that the product ID already exists.

Test Scenario 4: Product with missing mandatory fields
Given a Product object with missing mandatory fields, when the `createProduct` method is called, then an exception should be thrown, indicating that all mandatory fields must be filled.

Test Scenario 5: Product with invalid fields
Given a Product object with invalid fields (i.e., a negative price), when the `createProduct` method is called, then an exception should be thrown, indicating that the field values are invalid.

Test Scenario 6: Product with large field values
Given a Product object with large field values that exceed the maximum allowed size, when the `createProduct` method is called, then an exception should be thrown, indicating that the field values exceed the maximum allowed size. 

Test Scenario 7: Product with special characters in fields
Given a Product object with special characters in text fields, when the `createProduct` method is called, then the product should be persisted in the product repository without any errors, and the same product should be returned. 

Test Scenario 8: Product with non-unique values in unique fields
Given a Product object with non-unique values in fields that are supposed to be unique, when the `createProduct` method is called, then an exception should be thrown, indicating that the field values must be unique. 

Test Scenario 9: Create multiple products
Given multiple valid Product objects, when the `createProduct` method is called for each product, then all products should be persisted in the product repository without any errors, and the same products should be returned in the order they were added. 

Test Scenario 10: Product with large text fields
Given a Product object with large text fields that do not exceed the maximum allowed size, when the `createProduct` method is called, then the product should be persisted in the product repository without any errors, and the same product should be returned.
