================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The method createProduct is directly exposed to the user input without any access control. This means a malicious user could manipulate the request to create products on behalf of another user.
Solution: Implement proper access controls and user authentication to ensure that the user is authorized to perform the action. Also, validate the input to ensure it is as expected.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: The application may be vulnerable to CSRF attacks if it does not utilize CSRF tokens. This could allow an attacker to trick a victim into submitting a malicious request.
Solution: Use CSRF tokens and check them for each state changing operations. Spring Security provides built-in CSRF support.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: The code does not check the validity of the input product. This could lead to various issues such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.
Solution: Always validate inputs. Use prepared statements to avoid SQL injection, encode data to avoid XSS, and verify that data is in the expected format.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to create a valid product

Details:  
  TestName: testCreateValidProduct
  Description: This test is meant to check the creation of a valid product. The target scenario is when a valid product object is passed as a parameter to the createProduct method. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Product object with all necessary fields filled.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the valid Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Product object against the original Product object.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the returned Product object is the same as the original Product object. This confirms that the product has been successfully saved in the repository.

Scenario 2: Test to create a product with missing mandatory fields

Details:  
  TestName: testCreateProductWithMissingFields
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when a product with missing mandatory fields is passed. The target scenario is when an invalid product object is passed as a parameter to the createProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid Product object with missing mandatory fields.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the invalid Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or error.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception or error is thrown when attempting to save an invalid product. This ensures that the product repository maintains data integrity by not allowing incomplete or invalid products.

Scenario 3: Test to create a product with existing product ID

Details:  
  TestName: testCreateProductWithExistingId
  Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the createProduct method when a product with an existing product ID is passed. The target scenario is when a product object with an existing product ID is passed as a parameter to the createProduct method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Product object with an existing product ID.
  Act: Invoke the createProduct method with the Product object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception or error.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that an exception or error is thrown when attempting to save a product with an existing product ID. This ensures that the product repository maintains unique product IDs.
