================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The method updates a product's details based on user input without sanitizing the content, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into product fields such as name and description.
Solution: Implement input validation and sanitization for product fields to remove or encode special HTML characters.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The updateProduct method does not validate the incoming product data, which may lead to business logic errors or unintended application behavior.
Solution: Add server-side validation logic to verify that the provided Product object has valid and expected data before processing it.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method exposes internal product details in the response, possibly including sensitive information not intended for public display.
Solution: Review the Product class's data members and apply filtering or DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to limit the exposure of sensitive data in the API response.

Vulnerability: CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
Issue: There are no mechanisms shown to prevent an attacker from making repeated update attempts to guess IDs and modify products, leading to a brute force vulnerability.
Solution: Implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute force attacks on product update endpoints.

Vulnerability: CWE-639: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
Issue: By controlling the product ID in the URL path, an attacker may be able to modify products for which they should not have access, as no authorization checking is present.
Solution: Ensure proper authorization checks are in place to verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to modify a product.

Vulnerability: CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
Issue: Without proper access control checks, unauthorized users may be able to update product details.
Solution: Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) to assign and check permissions before allowing access to critical operations like updating a product.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: If the product data contains URLs (e.g., for images or callbacks) and the server makes any outbound requests to those URLs, there's a risk of SSRF attacks.
Solution: Validate and sanitize any URLs present in the product fields and implement a whitelist of allowed domains/services for outbound requests.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful product update

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithValidId
  Description: This test ensures the method properly updates a product when provided with a valid product ID and new product details.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a product when findById is invoked with a valid ID. Prepare a Product object with new details.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with the mock ProductRepository, a valid product ID, and the new Product object.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity contains the updated Product and has an OK (200) status.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the product is successfully updated with new details. It is essential to confirm that the update operation correctly persists changes and maintains the integrity of the product's information.

Scenario 2: Product update with non-existing ID

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithInvalidId
  Description: This test checks the method's behavior when attempting to update a product with an ID that does not exist in the repository.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a non-existing ID.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with the mock ProductRepository and a non-existing product ID.
  Assert: Verify that the ResponseEntity has a NOT_FOUND (404) status.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures the method correctly handles cases where the product does not exist. A 404 status code should be returned, indicating to the caller that the requested resource could not be found.

Scenario 3: Update product with null values

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNullValues
  Description: Test the method's ability to handle null values for the product's name, description, or price.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a product with certain fields set to non-null values. Prepare a Product object with some or all properties set to null.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with the mock ProductRepository, a valid product ID, and the Product object containing null properties.
  Assert: Check that the ResponseEntity contains the product with non-null fields preserved and null fields not updated.
Validation:
  This test ensures that updating a product with null values does not overwrite existing non-null values. It's important that the method allows for partial updates without data loss.

Scenario 4: Product update with negative price value

Details:
  TestName: updateProductWithNegativePrice
  Description: This test ensures that the method does not allow updates to a product with a negative price value when given a valid product ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an existing product. Prepare a Product object with a negative price value.
  Act: Invoke the updateProduct method with the mock ProductRepository, a valid product ID, and the new Product object.
  Assert: Validate that the operation throws an appropriate exception or that the ResponseEntity contains an error message / status indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the method does not perform updates with invalid data such as a negative price. It guards the integrity of the product data by rejecting invalid modifications.
