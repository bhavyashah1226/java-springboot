================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: In the current code, when a product is not found, a generic 404 not found is returned. If detailed error messages are returned, it could potentially reveal sensitive information about your application's internal workings, which could be exploited by attackers.
Solution: It's recommended to return a custom error message that doesn't reveal sensitive information. Consider implementing a global exception handling mechanism to ensure consistent error responses.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getProductById method uses GET request where the product id is present in the URL. If sensitive data is passed as part of the URL, it can be logged in various places like browser history, server logs, etc.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive data in the URL. If necessary, use POST request instead of GET or encrypt the data before passing it in the URL.

Vulnerability: CWE-384: Session Fixation
Issue: The application doesn't seem to handle user sessions. If an attacker is able to fixate the session ID of a user, they can hijack the user's session and gain unauthorized access to the system.
Solution: Implement proper session management. Regenerate session ID after login and logout. Consider using Spring Security or similar frameworks for robust security.

Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns a product when given a valid id

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithValidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns a valid product when provided with a valid product id. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a specific product when findById is called with a certain id.
    Act: Invoke getProductById with the id used to mock the ProductRepository.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the expected product and has a status of OK.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly fetches a product by its id. The expected result is that the product returned matches the one setup in the mock repository.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a not found response when given an invalid id

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithInvalidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns a not found response when provided with an invalid product id. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a certain id.
    Act: Invoke getProductById with the id used to mock the ProductRepository.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a status of NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where no product is found for a given id. The expected result is a not found status code.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method handles null ids correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNullId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles the case where a null id is passed in. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke getProductById with null as the id.
    Assert: Assert that an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where a null id is passed in. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException.
