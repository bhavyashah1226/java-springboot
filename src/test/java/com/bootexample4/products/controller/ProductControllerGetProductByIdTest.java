================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If the 'id' parameter is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, it may lead to SQL Injection where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query.
Solution: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries to avoid SQL Injection. Never build SQL queries using string concatenation with unsanitized input.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Returning the whole product object might expose sensitive data. If the product object contains sensitive data fields, they will be exposed to the client.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information. Always check what data is being sent to the client and limit it to what's necessary. Create DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) that only contain necessary fields.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: If the 'id' parameter is used in file operations, it can lead to directory traversal attacks where an attacker can read/write files outside of the intended directory.
Solution: Always sanitize input that will be used in file operations. Do not allow direct user input to dictate file paths.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Without proper protections, attackers may trick users into executing unwanted actions on a web application in which they're authenticated.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens and check them for each state-changing request. Frameworks usually have built-in protections against CSRF.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method returns a product when given a valid id

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithValidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns a valid product when provided with a valid product id. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return a specific product when findById is called with a certain id.
    Act: Invoke getProductById with the id used to mock the ProductRepository.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity contains the expected product and has a status of OK.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly fetches a product by its id. The expected result is that the product returned matches the product setup in the mock repository.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method returns a not found response when given an invalid id

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithInvalidId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method returns a not found response when provided with an invalid product id. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ProductRepository to return an empty Optional when findById is called with a certain id.
    Act: Invoke getProductById with the id used to mock the ProductRepository.
    Assert: Assert that the returned ResponseEntity has a status of NOT_FOUND.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where no product is found for a given id. The expected result is a status of NOT_FOUND, indicating that the requested product does not exist.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method handles null id properly

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetProductByIdWithNullId
    Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles a null id properly. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke getProductById with null as the id.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the case where a null id is provided. The expected result is an exception, as null is not a valid id.
