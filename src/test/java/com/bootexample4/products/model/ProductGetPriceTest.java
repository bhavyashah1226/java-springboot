================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Sensitive data might be exposed through query strings in GET requests if it is used in any part of the application. This data can be logged in various places, including the user's browser, the web server, and any forward or reverse proxy servers between the two endpoints.
Solution: Avoid placing sensitive information in query strings. Use POST requests when transferring sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Detailed error messages can expose sensitive information about the application, which attackers can use to exploit the system. This could be a problem if the application is not properly handling exceptions.
Solution: Use a global exception handler that catches all unhandled exceptions and return a generic error message.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Without proper protection, attackers might trick a victim into performing actions on behalf of the attacker. This could be a problem if the application is not properly validating request origins.
Solution: Include a CSRF token in each session and verify the token at the server side when receiving a request.

Scenario 1: Verify that the getPrice method returns the correct price

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getPrice method returns the correct price that has been previously set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned price is the same as the one set in the Arrange step.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly retrieves the set price. This is important as it ensures the price information is accurately retrieved when needed.

Scenario 2: Check that the getPrice method returns a default value when no price has been set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultWhenNoPriceSet
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getPrice method returns a default value (like 0.0) when no price has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set a price.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned price is the default value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method returns a default value when no price has been set. This is important for handling situations where a price has not been set yet.

Scenario 3: Check that the getPrice method returns the correct price after it has been updated

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsUpdatedValue
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getPrice method returns the correct price after it has been updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the price to a known value, then update it to a new value.
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned price is the new updated value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the getPrice method correctly retrieves the updated price. This is important as it ensures the price information is accurately updated and retrieved when needed.
