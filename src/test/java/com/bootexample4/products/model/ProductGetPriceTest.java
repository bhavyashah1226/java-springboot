================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unsanitized user inputs (CWE-20)
Issue: Applications that directly use user inputs in the critical operations without proper validation are prone to security risks, including code injection, command injection, etc.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user inputs. Use techniques such as input validation (whitelisting), output encoding, parameterized queries, etc.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control (CWE-285)
Issue: The absence of necessary access controls can result in unauthorized access and operations.
Solution: Implement necessary access controls in all privileged areas. Use authorization libraries in Java like Apache Shiro or Spring Security.

Vulnerability: Hard-coded credentials/secrets (CWE-798)
Issue: The presence of hard-coded secrets in code makes it vulnerable to exposure. This could provide malicious users with easy access to system resources.
Solution: Use secret management solutions to securely store secrets. Never hard-code sensitive information in code.

Scenario 1: Test to validate if getPrice method returns the correct price value 

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsCorrectValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getPrice method. The target scenario involves invoking this method and comparing the returned value against a previously set price. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a test double or a mock for the object and set a price value. 
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the returned price against the previously set price.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method is correctly returning the previously set price. The expected result is aligned with the aim of getPrice method, which is to return the correct price value. The significance of the test is to validate the basic functionality of the getPrice method, ensuring that it functions as expected in the given context.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if getPrice method returns the default price value when no price is set.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPriceReturnsDefaultPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getPrice method when price has not been set. The target scenario involves invoking this method without setting a price. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a test double or a mock for the object without setting a price value. 
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the returned price against the default price(likely zero, but depends on the implementation).
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method correctly returns the default price when no price has been set. The expected result is aligned with aim of getPrice method. This test scenario becomes significant as it tests the getPrice method's behavior in a scenario when no price has been set, contributing to robust error handling in the application.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if getPrice method functions correctly over multiple invocations. 

Details:  
  TestName: testGetPricePersistentCorrectValue.
  Description: This test is meant to check the persistent functionality of the getPrice method. The target scenario involves invoking this method multiple times and checking for consistent results. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Use a test double or a mock for the object and set a price value. 
  Act: Invoke the getPrice method multiple times. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertion to compare the returned price each time against the previously set price.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify if the getPrice method consistently returns the correct value over multiple invocations. The expected result is consistent with the purpose of the getPrice method. The importance of this test lies in ensuring that the method's functionality remains intact and consistent across multiple calls, which is crucial for stable application functioning.
