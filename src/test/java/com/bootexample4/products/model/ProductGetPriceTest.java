Scenario 1: Check correctness of returned price

  Details:
    TestName: validPriceReturned.
    Description: Validates that getPrice method returns the correct price that has been set for the product.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product instance and set the price.
    Act: Call getPrice method on the product instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned price matches the one that was set.
  Validation:
    The test aims to ensure that the getPrice method is correctly retrieving the value of the price private field. This is fundamental for the business logic as wrong prices can lead to revenue loss or customer frustrations.

Scenario 2: Check getPrice with uninitialized price

  Details:
    TestName: defaultPriceReturned.
    Description: Checks that getPrice returns a default value (zero) when the price has not been initialized.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product instance without setting its price.
    Act: Call getPrice method on the product instance.
    Assert: Check that the returned price is zero.
  Validation:
    The test validates getPrice's behavior when the price is not set. It's important to ensure that the default price doesn't mislead the customer or the business and may need to be followed by a validation that ensures the price is set before the product details are shown to customers.

Scenario 3: Check getPrice after updating the price

  Details:
    TestName: updatedPriceReturned.
    Description: Tests that getPrice reflects the updated price after it has been changed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product instance, set an initial price, then change it to a new one.
    Act: Call getPrice method on the product instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned price matches the new price.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly reflects price updates. It's vital to ensure that when the business updates a product price, that is accurately reflected to the customers.

Scenario 4: Check getPrice with negative price value

  Details:
    TestName: negativePriceReturned.
    Description: Validates that getPrice does not return a negative price value as product prices normally can't be negative.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product instance and set the price to a negative value.
    Act: Call getPrice method on the product instance.
    Assert: Check that the returned price is zero or throws an appropriate exception.
  Validation:
    The test verifies getPrice's behavior when the price is set to a negative value. It confirms the program can handle such an anomaly correctly and doesn't produce a misleading negative price.

Scenario 5: Check getPrice with maximum possible price

  Details:
    TestName: maximalPriceReturned.
    Description: Tests that getPrice can handle the maximum possible double value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a product instance and set the price to the maximum possible double value.
    Act: Call getPrice method on the product instance.
    Assert: Verify that the returned price matches the maximum double value.
  Validation:
    This test aims to check if the getPrice can handle edge scenarios where the price is set to an extremely high number effectively ensuring that the application can handle such rare but possible situations.
