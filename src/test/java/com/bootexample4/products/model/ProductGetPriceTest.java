"""
Scenario 1: Test to get the default price of a new product

Details:
  TestName: testGetDefaultPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check the default price of a new product i.e. when a product is created without setting any price to it. Most probably the default value should be zero.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product object.
    Act: Call the getPrice() method on the new product object.
    Assert: Assert equals with expected output (0) and actual output from getPrice method.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed to verify that a newly created product has the default price of 0. This test is significant to ensure that any product created should have a default price which will be zero.

Scenario 2: Test to get the price after setting it

Details:
  TestName: testGetPriceAfterSetting.
  Description: This test is to check the functionality of getPrice() method after setting some price to a product. It ensures that the getPrice method is returning the correct set price.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product object and set a price to it.
    Act: Call the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Assert equals with the price set and the price returned by getPrice() method.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed to verify that getPrice() method is returning the correctly set price. This test is significant to ensure that product prices are being correctly set and retrieved.

Scenario 3: Test to check negative price scenario

Details:
  TestName: testNegativePriceSetting.
  Description: This test is to check the getPrice() method behavior when a negative price is set. The application must not allow setting negative prices.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product object and try to set a negative price.
    Act: Call the setPrice() method with negative price value and then getPrice() method.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate error or exception is thrown when trying to set a negative price.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aimed to verify that the application is throwing an error or exception and not allowing setting negative prices. This test is significant to ensure that no negative product prices are allowed.

Scenario 4: Test to check the price after resetting it

Details:
  TestName: testPriceReseting.
  Description: The test is to check the getPrice() method response when the price is set, then reset, and ultimately the getPrice method is called.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product object, set some price, reset it to some other value.
    Act: Call the getPrice() method.
    Assert: Assert equals with the newly reset price and the price returned by the getPrice() method.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly returns the reset price value. The test is important to check the reset price mechanism.
