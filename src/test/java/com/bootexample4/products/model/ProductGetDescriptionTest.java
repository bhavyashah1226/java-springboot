================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions 
Issue: Java allows to set default permissions, if not properly handled, may expose sensitive information or resources.
Solution: Always specify minimum permissions that are required for the specific task.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: In case of manual SQL query creation, there's a high risk of SQL injection if user input is included in query without proper sanitization.
Solution: Use prepared statements with variable binding (parameterized queries) instead of manually constructing SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: Unsanitized user input that is used directly can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always sanitize user input, use encoding functions before rendering user-supplied data.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Exposure of sensitive information in exceptions or logging without proper handling.
Solution: Sensitive information should not be revealed in debugging and error messages. Use custom error messages.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: If user-supplied input file names are not sanitized, an attacker can escape out of the intended directory and gain unauthorized read access.
Solution: Validate and sanitize user input. Avoid using user-supplied input to form file names.

"""
Scenario 1: Verify the correct description is returned

Details:  
  TestName: verifyCorrectDescriptionReturned
  Description: This test is meant to check that the getDescription method correctly returns the stored description.  
Execution:
  Arrange: An object with a known description is set up. 
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the object.
  Assert: The returned description equals the known value.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the getDescription method correctly returns the description as expected. 
  This is a simple validation of the functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Description not set

Details:  
  TestName: verifyDescriptionNotSet
  Description: This test is to verify the behavior when no description is set. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An object is set up, but no description is given.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the object.
  Assert: The returned description is null or empty.
Validation: 
  The test verifies that if a description is not set, the null or empty value is returned. This is important for the correct handling of data and avoiding NullPointerExceptions.

Scenario 3: Description is a long string

Details:  
  TestName: verifyDescriptionLongString
  Description: The test is designed to verify the behavior if the description is a long string, larger than expected or normal case. 
Execution:
  Arrange: An object is created with a long description string.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the object.
  Assert: The returned description matches the long string.
Validation: 
  The goal is to verify that the method functions correctly even when the description is a longer string than normal.
  This is used to test the robustness of the application to handle large strings.

Scenario 4: Description is a string with special characters

Details:  
  TestName: verifyDescriptionWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test is to verify the behavior when the description contains special characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: An object is created where the description contains special characters.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the object.
  Assert: The returned description matches the string with special characters.
Validation: 
   This test will confirm that the getDescription method can handle descriptions with special characters.
   This type of verification is necessary to ensure the system can handle a variety of input cases.
