================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: If the 'description' variable holds sensitive data, this getter method could potentially expose it.
Solution: Ensure that sensitive data is properly encrypted and that access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if getDescription method returns the correct description

Details:  
  TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnsCorrectValue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getDescription method returns the correct description that was set for the object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object and set a description for it.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the created object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned description against the one that was set.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method is working as expected. The expected result is the description that was set for the object. This test is significant in the context of application behavior because it ensures that the correct description is returned when the method is called.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getDescription method returns null when the description is not set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnsNullIfNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getDescription method returns null when a description was not set for the object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object without setting a description.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the created object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned description is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method returns null when the description is not set. This is the expected result because no description was set for the object. This test is significant in the context of application behavior because it ensures that the method handles the case when no description is set correctly.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getDescription method returns an empty string when the description is set to an empty string

Details:  
  TestName: testGetDescriptionReturnsEmptyStringIfSetToEmpty
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getDescription method returns an empty string when the description is set to an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object and set the description to an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the getDescription method on the created object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned description is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getDescription method returns an empty string when the description is set to an empty string. This is the expected result because the description was set to an empty string. This test is significant in the context of application behavior because it ensures that the method handles the case when the description is an empty string correctly.
