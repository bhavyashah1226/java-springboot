ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getId_ba349b1eff

Scenario 1: Test to check if the getId method returns the correct Id

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method is returning the correct Id value. The target scenario is when the getId method is called on an instance of the class. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set the Id value.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Id value against the set Id value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is returning the correct value. The expected result is the same Id that was set on the instance. This test is significant in ensuring that the getId method is functioning as expected and returning the correct Id value.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getId method returns null when Id is not set

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullWhenIdNotSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns null when the Id is not set. The target scenario is when the getId method is called on an instance of the class without setting an Id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting an Id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned Id value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method returns null when the Id is not set. The expected result is null. This test is significant in ensuring that the getId method is functioning as expected and handles the case when the Id is not set.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getId method returns the correct Id after the Id is updated

Details:  
  TestName: testGetIdReturnsUpdatedId
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getId method returns the updated Id value. The target scenario is when the getId method is called after the Id is updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class, set an initial Id value, and then update the Id.
  Act: Invoke the getId method on the created instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned Id value against the updated Id value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getId method is returning the updated Id value. The expected result is the updated Id value. This test is significant in ensuring that the getId method is functioning as expected after an Id update.
