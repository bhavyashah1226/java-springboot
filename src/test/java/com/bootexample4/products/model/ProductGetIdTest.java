================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Object References (CWE-610)
Issue: The current setId method can potentially be exploited to manipulate object references if no validation checks are in place.
Solution: Implement validation checks to ensure the object references cannot be tampered with.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: Potential SQL injections if any database operation is happening with data that hasn't been previously sanitized.
Solution: Use Parameterized Query or PreparedStatement to mitigate the SQL Injection vulnerability.

Vulnerability: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring (CWE-778)
Issue: Issues can go undetected if there is insufficient logging and monitoring.
Solution: Ensure all access and functions are properly logged and monitored to discover potential breaches quickly.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the getId method is returning the correct ID value
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdReturnValue.
    Description: This test will ensure that the getId method is accurately returning the ID of the instance on which it is called. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance with a known id. 
    Act: Call the getId method on the created instance. 
    Assert: Compare the value returned by the getId method with the known id.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aim here is to verify that the getId method is correctly retrieving the id of the instance. If the getId method is working correctly, it should return the known id we used when setting up the test.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the getId method is handling null ID values
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdWithNullId.
    Description: This test will check if the getId method handles instances where the id is null properly.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance with a null id. 
    Act: Call the getId method on the created instance. 
    Assert: Assert that the return value is null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aim here is to verify that the getId method correctly returns null when the id of the instance is null. The getId method should not throw an error or exception when the id is null.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the getId method is thread-safe
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdThreadSafety.
    Description: This test will check if the getId method can be safely called from multiple threads.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance with a known id. Instantiate multiple threads that call the getId method on the created instance. 
    Act: Start all threads. 
    Assert: Assert that all threads return the same id.
  Validation: 
    The assertion's aim is to verify the getId method's thread safety. If the getId method is thread-safe, all threads should return the same id.
    
Scenario 4: Test to check if the getId method is behaving consistently
  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdConsistentBehavior.
    Description: This test will check if the getId method returns the same value every time it is called on the same instance.  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance with a known id. 
    Act: Call the getId method multiple times on the created instance. 
    Assert: Assert that all calls to getId return the same id.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aim here is to verify the consistency of the getId method. If the getId method is implemented correctly, it should always return the same id for the same instance.
