================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Injection
Issue: If user inputs are not properly sanitized or parametrized, it may allow attackers to alter queries and execute arbitrary commands or queries.
Solution: Always sanitize user inputs and use parameterized queries or prepared statements to protect against SQL injection.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure
Issue: Sensitive information may be exposed to attackers due to logging or storing sensitive information in cleartext.
Solution: Use proper logging levels to ensure sensitive information is not included in log output. Use encryption for storing sensitive data.

  Scenario 1: Check getId method returns the correct id.
  
  Details: 
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsCorrectId.
    Description: This test will check if the getId method returns the correct id for the entity. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock entity with a known id and save it.
    Act: Call the getId method on the mock entity.
    Assert: Check if the id returned by the getId method matches the known id of the entity.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the getId method is functional and correctly returns the id of the entity. 
    This test is important as it ensures that the identity of the entity is preserved and correctly retrievable, which is crucial for numerous operations such as database read and write operations. 

  Scenario 2: Check getId method returns null if id is not set.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetIdReturnsNullIfNotSet.
    Description: This test will check if the getId method returns null if the id is not set for the entity. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock entity without setting an id.
    Act: Call the getId method on the mock entity
    Assert: Check if the id returned by the getId method is null.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the getId method correctly returns null if no id is set for the entity. 
    This test is significant to ensure proper behaviour and prevent unexpected results when dealing with entities that do not have an id set.

  Scenario 3: Test getId method with multiple calls.

  Details: 
    TestName: testGetIdWithMultipleCalls.
    Description: This test will check if the getId method returns the same id with multiple calls.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock entity with a known id and save it
    Act: Call the getId method multiple times on the mock entity.
    Assert: Check if the id returned by the getId method is same for all calls.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that multiple calls to getId method don't affect the id getting returned. 
    It is important to ensure the id of an entity is immutable and consistent with multiple calls for proper functioning of the application.
