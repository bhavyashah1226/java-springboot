"Scenario 1: Object Instantiated But Id Not Set

Details:
    TestName: testIfIdNotSet
    Description: This test case checks that calling "getId()" on a product object that has just been instantiated, but not yet had its Id set, returns null.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object.
    Act: Call "getId()" method on the product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
    The Id of a newly instantiated product should not have any value until set. Hence the expectant null return value. This ensures that no product has a default id.

Scenario 2: Id Set Explicitly

Details:
    TestName: testSettingId
    Description: The test case is designed to verify whether "getId()" correctly retrieves the id after it has been set.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and call "setId()" method with a sample id.
    Act: Call "getId()" method on the product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is equal to the sample id set earlier.
Validation:
    This test ensures that the setId and getId methods work correctly, the correct id stored is returned when getId is invoked.

Scenario 3: Setting and Resetting Id

Details:
    TestName: testSettingAndResettingId
    Description: This test case is designed to verify the functionality of "getId()" after the id has been set, reset, and then set again.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and call "setId()" method twice, first with a sample id and then with another sample id.
    Act: Call "getId()" method on the product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the second sample id.
Validation:
    The getId should return the most recent set Id, even after multiple invocations of setId.

Scenario 4: Setting Id to Null

Details:
    TestName: testSettingIdToNull
    Description: This test case verifies "getId()" behavior after the id for the product object has been set to null explicitly.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object and call "setId()" method with null.
    Act: Call "getId()" method on the product object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
    This test proves that the getId method can handle and return null id gracefully, which ensures the robustness of the Product class implementation.

Scenario 5: “getId()” Invocation Without Any Prior Action

Details:
    TestName: testGetIdWithoutAnyPriorAction
    Description: This test case checks the behavior of the “getId()” method when invoked immediately after instantiation.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Product object.
    Act: Invoke the "getId()" method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.
Validation:
    This test ensures that, by default, until the setId method is invoked, getId method should return null. This is important in scenarios where products are created but not yet saved (thus not having any IDs).
