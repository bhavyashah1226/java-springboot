================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If sensitive information such as passwords are passed through GET requests, it can be exposed in server logs or browser history.

  Scenario 1: Test to check if setDescription method sets the description correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetDescription.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setDescription method is able to set the description correctly. The target scenario is when a valid description is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: A valid description is prepared as input data.
    Act: Invoke setDescription method with the valid description as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set description against the initial input data.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setDescription method correctly sets the description. The expected result is the same as the input data since that is what we set the description to. The significance of this test is to ensure that the setDescription method is working properly.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if setDescription method handles null input correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetDescriptionWithNullInput.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setDescription method can handle null inputs correctly. The target scenario is when null is provided as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Null is prepared as input data.
    Act: Invoke setDescription method with null as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set description against null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setDescription method correctly sets the description to null when null input is provided. The expected result is null since that is what we set the description to. The significance of this test is to ensure that the setDescription method can handle null inputs without crashing.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if setDescription method handles empty string input correctly

  Details:  
    TestName: testSetDescriptionWithEmptyString.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setDescription method can handle empty string inputs correctly. The target scenario is when an empty string is provided as the input.
  Execution:
    Arrange: An empty string is prepared as input data.
    Act: Invoke setDescription method with the empty string as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the set description against an empty string.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the setDescription method correctly sets the description to an empty string when an empty string input is provided. The expected result is an empty string since that is what we set the description to. The significance of this test is to ensure that the setDescription method can handle empty string inputs without crashing.
