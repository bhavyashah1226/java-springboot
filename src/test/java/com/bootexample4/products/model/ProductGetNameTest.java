================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure User Input Handling (CWE-20)
Issue: If the application does not properly validate user inputs, it can lead to various types of attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting etc.
Solution: Use input validation techniques and libraries (like OWASP's ESAPI) to protect against invalid or malicious input.

Vulnerability: Insecure File I/O operations (CWE-36)
Issue: Improper file handling can lead to various attacks such as path traversal, arbitrary file overwrite etc.
Solution: Use secure file handling libraries and always validate file paths and names.

Vulnerability: Insecure Database Operations (CWE-89)
Issue: If the application does not properly sanitize user inputs in database operations, it can lead to SQL injection attacks.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to protect against SQL injection.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify the returned name is correct

Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsCorrectName
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getName' method returns the correct name that is set for the instance of the class.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a known name.
    Act: Invoke the 'getName' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned name against the known name set.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'getName' method returns the correct name. This is crucial as other parts of the application may rely on this method to get the correct name of the instance.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the returned name is not null

Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsNotNull
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getName' method does not return a null value when the name is set.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set a known name.
    Act: Invoke the 'getName' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned name is not null.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'getName' method does not return null. This is important as returning null could lead to NullPointerExceptions in the application code.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the returned name is null when no name is set

Details:  
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsNullWhenNoNameSet
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getName' method returns null when no name is set for the instance.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the class without setting a name.
    Act: Invoke the 'getName' method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned name is null.
Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the 'getName' method returns null when no name is set. This is important as it reflects that the instance has no name set.
