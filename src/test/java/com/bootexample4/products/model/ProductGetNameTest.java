"""
  Scenario 1: Testing getName returns value successfully.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsSuccessfully.
    Description: This test verifies that the getName() method works correctly to retrieve the name of a Product that has already been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product instance and set its name using setName method.
    Act: Invoke the getName method on the created Product instance.
    Assert: Assert that the string returned by getName matches the string that was previously set.
  Validation:
    The assertion is validating if the getName method correctly retrieves the product's name as previously set. This is critical because the ability to accurately retrieve product information is essential for business logic.

  Scenario 2: Testing getName returns null.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetNameReturnsNull.
    Description: This test verifies that the getName() method returns null when called on a new instance of Product where no name has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Product instance without setting a name.
    Act: Invoke getName method on the created Product instance.
    Assert: Assert that getName method returns null.
  Validation:
    The assertion is validating that the getName method returns null when no name has been set for the product. This is in line with the expected behavior as no name has been saved yet for the new product instance.
