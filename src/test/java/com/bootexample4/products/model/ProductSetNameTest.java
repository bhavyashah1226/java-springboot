================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The setName function in the model class does not appear to validate the 'name' parameter. This could allow an attacker to pass malicious data, perform injection attacks, or induce null pointer exceptions.
Solution: Implement proper input validation for the 'name' parameter in setName function to prevent exploitation of this issue. Use a reliable data sanitization library to sanitize inputs, and/or use positive whitelisting to only allow expected values.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of NoSQL database without proper mitigations
Issue: Using autogenerated IDs could expose your application to idor (Insecure Direct Object Reference) attacks if IDs are exposed and based on sequential patterns.
Solution: Ensure that auto-generated IDs are not exposed to the end user. Additionally, implement proper access controls such as ownership verification to ensure that users can only access data they are authorized for.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if proper value is being set 

Details:
  TestName: testIfProperValueIsSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method is properly setting the value of name correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a test object of the class and set a valid string value to it using the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the getName() method of the test object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected string value.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the setName method is properly setting the value to the field. The significance of this test lies in ensuring that the basic functionality of the setName method works correctly.


Scenario 2: Test to check if null value is allowed

Details:
  TestName: checkIfNullValueAllowed
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method allows null as a valid name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a test object of the class and set the null value to it using the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the getName() method of the test object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if null is received as output.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to check if null is treated as a valid value for name. This test is significant in checking handling of null inputs.


Scenario 3: Test to check if empty string is allowed

Details:
  TestName: checkIfEmptyStringAllowed
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method allows an empty string as a valid name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a test object of the class and set an empty string value to it using the setName method. 
  Act: Invoke the getName() method of the test object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if an empty string is received as output.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if an empty string is treated as a valid name. This test is significant in checking the handling of empty string inputs.


Scenario 4: Test to check if white space is allowed

Details:
  TestName: checkIfWhiteSpaceAllowed
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setName method allows a string with only white spaces as a valid name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a test object of the class and set a string value with only white spaces to it using the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the getName() method of the test object.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a string with only white spaces is received as output.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if a string with only white spaces is treated as a valid name. This test is significant in checking the handling of string inputs with only white spaces.
