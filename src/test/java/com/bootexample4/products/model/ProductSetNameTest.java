================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: If sensitive information such as passwords are passed through GET requests, it can be exposed in server logs or browser history.
Solution: Avoid passing sensitive information as a query string in GET requests. Use POST requests instead, or encrypt the data before sending.

"""
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Name Input

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameWithValidInput.
  Description: This test checks if the method setName correctly assigns the input string to the name variable. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with a valid string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name variable in the class instance is equal to the input string.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the setName method correctly assigns the input string to the name variable. This test ensures that the method correctly handles valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test for Null Input

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameWithNullInput.
  Description: This test checks if the method setName correctly handles null input and doesn't throw an exception. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name variable in the class instance is null.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the setName method correctly handles null inputs. It is important to ensure that the method doesn't throw an exception when provided with null input.

Scenario 3: Test for Empty String Input

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameWithEmptyString.
  Description: This test checks if the method setName correctly handles an empty string as input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with an empty string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name variable in the class instance is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the setName method correctly handles empty string inputs. This test ensures that the method doesn't throw an exception when provided with an empty string.

Scenario 4: Test for Long String Input

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNameWithLongString.
  Description: This test checks if the method setName correctly handles a long string as input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setName method.
  Act: Invoke the setName method with a long string as a parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the name variable in the class instance is equal to the long string.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the setName method correctly handles long string inputs. It is important to ensure that the method doesn't throw an exception when provided with a long string.
