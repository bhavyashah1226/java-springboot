================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If setId() method is publicly accessible, it might lead to evergreen risks like unauthorized record modification or data leakage.
Solution: Ensure the correct access controls are in place, prevent unauthorized users from being able to set IDs or access sensitive data. Review authentication and authorization strategies within the application.

Vulnerability: Excessive Data Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: Without proper restrictions, this.id might get exposed to the user unintentionally leading to potential data leakage.
Solution: Enforce strict access control methods ensuring minimum data exposure principle. If not necessary, avoid using setter method for the 'id' field as it's usually auto-generated by JPA.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
Issue: If user-supplied input directly reflected back to user without sanitization, it might lead to cross-site scripting attack.
Solution: All user inputs should be sanitized prior to rendering to the user to mitigate this risk.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Normal Case, Setting a standard Id
Details:  
  TestName: setIdHappyPath
  Description: Test the setId method to ensure it accurately sets the Id for object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object without an id.
  Act: Call the setId method with a standard id value (not null and not a negative number).
  Assert: Verify the id of the object is equal to the id we set.
Validation: 
  Expected result is the same as the passed id value, as setId method is supposed to set id to the object. The test ensures that the function works as expected in normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Edge Case, Setting a null Id
Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithNull
  Description: Test the setId method to ensure it appropriately handles when given a null value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object without an id.
  Act: Call the setId method with a null value.
  Assert: Capture the exception and verify that it's the correct type.
Validation: 
  Expected result is a NullPointerException, as setId method isn't supposed to accept null values. This test ensures that the function handles error cases appropriately.

Scenario 3: Edge Case, Setting a negative Id
Details:  
  TestName: setIdWithNegativeValue
  Description: Test the setId method to ensure it appropriately handles when given a negative value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object without an id.
  Act: Call the setId method with a negative value.
  Assert: Capture the exception and verify that it's the correct type.
Validation: 
  Expected result is a IllegalArgumentException, as setId method isn't supposed to accept negative values. This test ensures that the function handles edge cases correctly.
  
Scenario 4: Subsequent Cases, Setting Id twice
Details:  
  TestName: setIdTwice
  Description: Test the setId method to see how it behaves when the id already exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an object and set an id.
  Act: Call the same setId method with a new (different) id.
  Assert: Verify the now set id matches the new id and not the initial one.
Validation: 
  Expected result is the new id, as there's no rule preventing an id from being set twice. Test aims to verify that the function allows id updates.
