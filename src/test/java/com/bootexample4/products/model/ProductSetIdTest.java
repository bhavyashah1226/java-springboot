================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Jakarta Persistence Entity Exposure
Issue: Without knowing the fields and context of the Entity, having public setter can potentially expose internal state of the Entity object that might be sensitive.
Solution: Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to pass data around, without providing outsiders direct access to the entity or consider making setter methods package-private or protected if possible.

Vulnerability: Lack of Input Validation
Issue: This public setId(Long id) method could set the `id` value of an object with any provided value without checking its validity, it might potentially harm the data integrity.
Solution: Validate the input before setting the value to the id field to ensure it conforms to the expected format and is within acceptable range.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to verify the successful setting of valid ID

  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingValidId
    Description: This test is meant to verify the successful setting of a valid non-null ID to 'id' property. 
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare a valid non-null Long ID.
        Act: Invoke setId() method with the valid ID.
        Assert: Assert that the value of 'id' property equals the set ID.
    Validation: 
        This assertion aims to verify that setId() properly assigns the supplied ID to 'id' property. It indicates that the method is functioning as expected by effectively setting the 'id' value.

Scenario 2: Test to check the behavior when setting NULL ID
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testSettingNullId
    Description: This test aims to test the setId() method by providing a NULL ID, which is meant to observe how the method deals with null values. 
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare a null Long ID.
        Act: Invoke setId() method with the null ID.
        Assert: Assert that the value of 'id' property is NULL.
    Validation: 
        This assertion seeks to confirm that setting a NULL ID does not cause any unexpected behavior or exceptions. It proves that the method can handle null values gracefully.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the resetting of an ID
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testResettingId
    Description: This test checks if the method can successfully reset an already-set ID.
    Execution:
        Arrange: Prepare a valid non-null Long ID and another valid non-null Long resetId.
        Act: Invoke setId() method with the ID and reset it by invoking setId() again with resetId.
        Assert: Assert that the value of 'id' property equals the resetId.
    Validation: 
        This test aims to ensure that the method properly overwrites the existing 'id' value with the new value. This shows that the setId() method can effectively mitigate changes.
