================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the 'price' field is directly exposed to the user, it might lead to unauthorized access or modification of data.
Solution: Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to manage what data is exposed to the user. DTOs can provide a way to select what data can be modified by the user and what can be viewed.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation or CWE-20
Issue: The 'setPrice' method does not perform any validation on the input. This can lead to incorrect prices being set.
Solution: Always validate user input. In this case, check if the price is a positive number before setting it.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to check if the method sets a positive price correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSetPositivePrice
  Description: This test checks if the method sets a positive price correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setPrice method. Define a positive double value for the price.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the positive double value as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set correctly.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the price has been set correctly. The test ensures that the method works as expected for positive price values.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the method sets a price of zero correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSetZeroPrice
  Description: This test checks if the method sets a price of zero correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setPrice method. Define a double value of zero for the price.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the zero double value as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the price has been set to zero. The test ensures that the method works as expected for a price of zero.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the method sets a negative price correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSetNegativePrice
  Description: This test checks if the method sets a negative price correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setPrice method. Define a negative double value for the price.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the negative double value as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to the negative value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the price has been set to the negative value. The test ensures that the method works as expected for negative price values.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the method sets a very large price correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSetLargePrice
  Description: This test checks if the method sets a very large price correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the setPrice method. Define a very large double value for the price.
  Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the very large double value as parameter.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the price has been set to the large value.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the price has been set to the large value. The test ensures that the method can handle very large price values.
