"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Positive Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithPositiveValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when a positive value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a positive double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against the passed positive value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when a positive value is passed. This is essential to ensure that the pricing functionality works as expected.
  Scenario 2: Test for Zero Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithZeroValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method successfully sets the price when zero is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with zero.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when zero is passed. This is essential to ensure that the pricing functionality works as expected.
  Scenario 3: Test for Negative Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithNegativeValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method behaves correctly when a negative value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with a negative double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against zero or throw an exception.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is not set to a negative value or an exception is thrown. This is crucial to ensure the integrity of pricing data.
  Scenario 4: Test for Maximum Double Value Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithMaxDoubleValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method behaves correctly when the maximum possible double value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the maximum possible double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against the maximum possible double value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is set correctly when the maximum possible double value is passed. This is important to ensure the application can handle extreme cases.
  Scenario 5: Test for Minimum Double Value Price
  Details:
    TestName: testSetPriceWithMinDoubleValue.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the setPrice method behaves correctly when the minimum possible double value is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as the method doesn't depend on pre-existing data or conditions.
    Act: Invoke the setPrice method with the minimum possible double value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual price against zero or throw an exception.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the price is not set to a negative value or an exception is thrown when the minimum possible double value is passed. This is crucial to ensure the integrity of pricing data.
