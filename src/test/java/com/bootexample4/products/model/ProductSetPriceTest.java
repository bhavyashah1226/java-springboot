================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) or CWE-639
Issue: If the 'setPrice' method is exposed to the user directly, it could allow an attacker to modify the price of any product, leading to financial loss or other undesired behaviors.
Solution: Ensure proper access control checks are in place before allowing a user to modify the price. This could be implemented in the service layer that calls this setter method.

Vulnerability: Input Validation or CWE-20
Issue: The 'setPrice' method does not validate the provided price. This could lead to setting an invalid price for the product, like a negative value.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure the price is within a valid range before setting it.

"""
Scenario 1: Valid Price Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: setValidPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'setPrice' method accurately sets the price when a valid price value is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable, as we are directly setting a value.
  Act: Invoke the 'setPrice' method with a valid price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the 'price' field has been set to the expected value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setPrice' method correctly sets the 'price' field. The expected result is the price that was passed to the method. This test is significant as it validates the basic functionality of the 'setPrice' method.

Scenario 2: Negative Price Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: setNegativePrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'setPrice' method handles a negative price input correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable, as we are directly setting a value.
  Act: Invoke the 'setPrice' method with a negative price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the 'price' field remains unchanged or is set to zero (depends on the method implementation).
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setPrice' method does not allow negative prices. The expected result depends on the application's business logic - either the price remains unchanged or is set to zero. This test is important as it checks how the method handles incorrect input.

Scenario 3: Zero Price Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: setZeroPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'setPrice' method correctly handles a zero price input. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable, as we are directly setting a value.
  Act: Invoke the 'setPrice' method with a zero price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the 'price' field is set to zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setPrice' method allows a zero price. The expected result is that the price field is set to zero. This test is significant as it checks how the method handles edge cases.

Scenario 4: High Price Input Test

Details:  
  TestName: setHighPrice.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the 'setPrice' method can handle very high price values correctly. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Not applicable, as we are directly setting a value.
  Act: Invoke the 'setPrice' method with a very high price value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the 'price' field is set to the high value.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the 'setPrice' method can handle high price values. The expected result is that the price field is set to the high value. This test is significant as it tests the method's robustness.
